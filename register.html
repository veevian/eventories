  <div class="col-md-4"><p>The Wedding Planner Masterclass is an intensive workshop for wedding planners, focusing on education and inspiration from some of the top event industry professionals.</p>

<p>The 2020 Masterclass marks our fifth workshop year. I developed the Wedding Planner Masterclass in 2015 after hearing from so many up-and-coming wedding planners seeking advice on growing their businesses. It’s a unique opportunity exclusively for wedding planners to learn from my years of experience, ask questions specific to their pressing needs, and be inspired to reach the highest levels in their work.</p>

<p>I’m thrilled to host this year’s attendees at Brush Creek Ranch, a magical and immersive property in picturesque Wyoming. Brush Creek Ranch is the perfect place for wedding planners to learn and dream about forging new frontiers in their careers.</p>
